Keep My Pets is a system that answer to owner of domestic animals that don’t know where to put their pets during vacations. 
And to cut the number of animals abandoned keep my pets helps shelter to find family that want to adopt pets. 
We know that the summer holidays is the time when animals are the most abandoned. 
So we can help owner to find easily cheap guardian to keep pets. We propose two way of keep system. 
The first is free, the owner find a guardian to keep his pet or pets free on a length of days. 
After the owner will keep pet or pets on the same length of days free. The second isn’t free, 
the owner will pay the guardian for a length of days so will not have to keep pets after. 
Also we help shelters and adopters to find each other. 
Adopters can find pets on our system and can contact shelter to adopt pet. 
We can go further by helping owner, shelter, guardian to find veterinary. 
So we can propose veterinary that will take care of pets and help adopters to find a pets as they want.
